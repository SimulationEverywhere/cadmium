## Introduction
This library provides model classes for multiple Discrete-Event Simulation formalisms and the tools to simulate those models.
This project goal is replace CD++ with a more flexible and better performant implementation. Initial research in the  architecture of Cadmium can be found in [Sequential PDEVS architecture](http://cell-devs.sce.carleton.ca/publications/2015/VNWD15/) paper. Our primary building tool is clang, but we also test builds using gcc and visual studio when having the resources to do so.

## Top features
* Model validation at compile time.
* PDEVS models simulated in a single thread.
* Typed messages going through typed ports.
* Time representation is independent of model implementation.

## Quick start
### Requirements
* A C++14 compliant compiler.

### Install
* The library is headers only. Then, it is enough to put the include directory in the path the compiler looks up for them.

### Running cadmium in concurrent mode
By default, cadmium runs single threaded. There is also a concurrent version behind a flag, but it requires Boost.Thread library and some changes need to be made when compiling:
* The preprocessor variable CADMIUM_EXECUTE_CONCURRENT should be defined (add '-DCADMIUM_EXECUTE_CONCURRENT' when compiling ).
* Boost.Thread and Boost.System libraries should be linked (add '-lboost_system -lboost_thread')

### Building tests and examples
* Boost.Test, if running the testsfor running the tests.
* Boost.Build, if using the building files provided for convenience.
